# Business Plan / Investor Whitepaper — BFrame

## Summary
BFrame is an AI-native, modular business OS combining the usability of modern SaaS with the extensibility of open source. It unifies CRM, Sales, Inventory, Accounting, HR, Projects, and Analytics into a cohesive platform with automation and an AI assistant.

## Problem
SMBs juggle multiple disconnected tools. Integrations are brittle. ERPs are powerful but complex and costly. AI capabilities are bolted on, not native.

## Solution
A modular OS with a strong core: unified data, RBAC, event-driven workflows, and an AI layer that understands business context across modules.

## Product
- Core framework + installable modules
- Automation studio and conversational analytics
- Marketplace for third-party modules

## Business Model
- Open-core, paid cloud, premium AI/integrations, marketplace revenue share

## Market
- 300M+ SMBs worldwide; beachhead: startups and SMBs (10–100 employees)
- Competitive set: Odoo, Zoho, QuickBooks + Zapier stacks, vertical ERPs
- Positioning: “Odoo Simplified with AI”

## Go-To-Market
- Developer-first community; generous free tier
- Rapid onboarding (data importers); templates by vertical
- Partner/channel program for implementations

## Technology Moat
- Pluggable module architecture; strong workflow engine
- Unified semantic layer for AI across modules
- On-prem and cloud parity; compliance-forward design

## Traction Plan (Year 1)
- 3 design partners; 1k GitHub stars; 100 active cloud workspaces
- Marketplace with 10+ third-party modules

## Financial Model (Indicative)
- ARPU: $40–$120/month (SMB), upsell via modules and AI packs
- Gross margin target: 75–80%
- CAC/LTV discipline via content, community, and partners

## Risks & Mitigation
- Scope creep → strict module boundaries, phased delivery
- Incumbents → win on UX, AI-native workflows, dev ecosystem
- AI costs → cache, distill, and offer local LLMs where feasible

## Roadmap
See `docs/Roadmap.md` for milestones and team plan.
